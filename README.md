The developed approach utilizes the motion primitives for generating search trees and a replanning algorithm based on D-star lite. Along with the
position, the velocity of obstacles was also used to predict collision. After the way-point generation,
a locomotion controller and line-of-sight guidance were used for trajectory tracking.
The trajectory generated by the above approach was found to be dynamically feasible, collision
free and optimal given every obstacle motion remains constant.
